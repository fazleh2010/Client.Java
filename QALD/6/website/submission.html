<p>
Please note that you can participate in the challenge without submitting a paper (and also submit a paper without participating in the challenge, although your paper should have some connection to QALD).
</p>

<p>
All accepted challenge papers will be published by Springer in the <a href="http://www.springer.com/series/7899">CCIS series</a>.
In addition, ESWC will publish a selection of the best challenge papers in the Satellite Event proceedings (a separate Springer LNCS Volume)
along with a selection of best workshop, poster and demo papers. The best challenge paper authors may be asked to resubmit a somewhat extended
version of their paper.
Both the challenge proceedings and the Satellite Events proceedings will be compiled after the conference.
