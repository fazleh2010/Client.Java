<p>
Please note that any deadlines connected to the open challenge concern only the submission of answers and computed evaluation results, they do NOT concern paper submissions. Papers describing systems that participate in the challenge or using challenge data for evaluation have to be submitted until March 16. There is no separate paper submission in the context of the challenge. If you want to include results from the test phase into your paper as well (which we strongly encourage), you can still do this when preparing the camera-ready version of the paper.
