<h1>Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD-2)</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While more and more semantic data is published on the Web, the question of how typical Web users 
can access this body of knowledge becomes of crucial importance. 
Therefore there is a growing amount of research on interaction paradigms that allow end users 
to profit from the expressive power of Semantic Web standards while at the same time hiding 
the complexity behind an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. 
These paradigms range from keyword search, faceted browsing and exploration to natural language 
question answering.</p>

<p>Despite different goals and different kinds of interaction, the main challenge involved in 
interacting with Linked Data is the same for all paradigms: dealing with a heterogeneous, 
distributed and very large set of highly interconnected data. 
The availability of such an amount of open and structured data has no precedents in computer 
science and approaches that can deal with the specific character of Linked Data are urgently 
needed.</p>

<p>The workshop <i>Interacting with Linked Data</i> is aimed at all researchers and 
practitioners working on the interaction with Linked Data and related topics.
Our goal is to bring together expertise from different communities, including NLP, 
HCI and Semantic Web, and want to encourage communication across interaction paradigms.</p>

<h2>The following topics are of special interest:</h2> 
<ul>
<li>Question answering and natural language interfaces to Linked Data</li>
<li>HCI and Linked Data</li>
<li>Faceted browsing and exploration</li>
<li>New interaction metaphors for Linked Data</li>
<li>Multimodal interfaces to Linked Data</li>
<li>Disambiguation and inferencing across multiple sources and domains </li>
<li>Natural language generation</li>
<li>Discovery on the fly of relevant Linked Data sources</li>
<li>Efficiency and performance aspects</li>
<li>Dealing with data and schema heterogeneity</li>
<li>Summarization and aggregation</li>
<li>Providing justifications of answers and conveying trust</li>
<li>Personalization in accessing Linked Data</li>
<li>User feedback and interaction</li>
<li>Habitability and usability aspects</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to facilitate the comparison between different approaches and systems within a particular 
(considerably powerful) interaction paradigm, the workshop will be accompanied by an open challenge on 
Question Answering over Linked Data.</p>
