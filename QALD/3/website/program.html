<h2>Invited Talk: Anthony Fader (University of Washington, <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~afader/">homepage</a>)<br /> Open-Domain Question Answering</h2>

<p align="justify">
Creating general question-answering (QA) systems is a long-standing problem in artificial intelligence. QA systems that interpret questions, reason over evidence, and return useful answers would be a powerful tool for users, potentially replacing search engines as the de facto standard for information access on the web.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In this talk, I will present some recent work towards creating a large-scale, open-domain QA system that (1) automatically constructs a knowledge base from text, and (2) learns to answer questions over the knowledge base using social QA sites (e.g. WikiAnswers) as a source of supervision. The first part of my talk will focus on a novel algorithm that learns from naturally occurring question-paraphrases, without requiring any manually annotated questions. The second part of my talk will focus on scaling the system to work with larger knowledge bases, handle more complex questions, and rank answers for higher precision.
