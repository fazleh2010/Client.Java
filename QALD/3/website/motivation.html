<h1>Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD-3)</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <b>CLEF 2013 lab QALD-3</b> ist the third in a series of evaluation campaigns on 
question answering over linked data, this time with a strong emphasis on multilinguality.</p>

<p>It offers two <b>open challenges</b>:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="index.php?x=task1&q=3">Task 1: Multilingual question answering</a></li>
<li><a href="index.php?x=task2&q=3">Task 2: Ontology lexicalization</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> &nbsp; </p>

Please register for the lab using the <a href="http://www.clef2013.org/index.php?page=Pages/registrationForm.php">CLEF 2013 registration form</a> 
(open until April 20, 2013).

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>While more and more semantic data is published on the Web, the question of how typical
Web users can access this body of knowledge becomes of crucial importance. Over the past
years, there is a growing amount of research on interaction paradigms that allow end users to
profit from the expressive power of Semantic Web standards while at the same time hiding
their complexity behind an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. Especially natural language
interfaces have received wide attention, as they allow users to express arbitrarily complex
information needs in an intuitive fashion and, at least in principle, in their own language.
The key challenge lies in translating the users' information needs into a form such that they
can be evaluated using standard Semantic Web query processing and inferencing techniques.
To this end, systems have to deal with a heterogeneous, distributed and very large set of highly
interconnected data. The availability of such an amount of open and structured data has no
precedents in computer science and approaches that can deal with the specific character of
linked data are urgently needed.</p>

<p>In addition, multilinguality has become an issue of major interest for the Semantic Web
community, as both the number of actors creating and publishing data all in languages other
than English, as well as the amount of users that access this data and speak native languages
other than English is growing substantially. In order to achieve the goal that users from all
countries have access to the same information, there is an impending need for systems that
can help in overcoming language barriers by facilitating multilingual access to semantic data
originally produced for a different culture and language.</p>
